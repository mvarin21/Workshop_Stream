    "- Avoid code repetition. Make many small functions that you know work for parts of problems, and use them repeatedly.\n",
    "- Once you have working functions, consider how to make those functions \"generalized\" so that they will work flexibly in future analyses across different experiment types or conditions! This will really boost your analysis productivity.\n",
    "- Break problems down into steps that you can put into functions. Give them clear inputs and outputs. This will help you guard variable scope much better.  For example, nested for loops can often be turned into single loops with named function calls, making code much clearer.\n",
    "- If you want very clear and organized analyses, make use of Python classes to organize your data! This is worth learning. The design goal of classes is to combine \"data\" and \"functions that operate on that data\". You can use this to keep associated analysis data together and organized, and also separate from OTHER data in the same analysis."

    "## Inter-Response Time Curves\n",
    "An inter-response time (IRT) is defined as the time between two successive recalls.  In the IRT curves, seen in FHM figure 6.11, we want to plot the IRT as a function of both transition position and total number of recalls on the list.  Essentially, in an IRT plot, we want IRT on the y-axis, transition position on the x-axis, and a different curve for each number of total recalls on the list.  Each point on the graph should represent an average IRT for the given transition position and total number of recalls."

    "## Lag-CRP\n",
    "The Lag Conditional Response Probability (**Lag-CRP**) is a calculation measuring the temporal organization of memory.  When we transition freely from one recall to another, are we more likely to transition between items that were presented close together in time or far apart in time?  The Lag-CRP calculation is essentially considering each **lag**, or the serial position jump between adjacent recalls, and then dividing the number of actual transitions bt the number of possible transitions, giving a **conditional response probability**.  See http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/CRP_Tutorial for an example of the concept and FHM figure 6.8 for an example of the graph.  Remember that repeats and intrusions (words not from the list) can appear in the recall events, and must be dealt with."
