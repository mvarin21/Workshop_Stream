    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will analyze a multi-session free recall experiment to determine the spectral biomarkers of successful memory encoding. To determine differences in brain activity (EEG signals) that predict whether a studied item will be subsequently remembered (recalled) you will compare two classes of events: word encoding that led to later recall and those that did not. The first part of this assignment will ask you to analyze data from the ltpFR2 dataset (Kahana et al., 2018, JEP:LMC). The second part of the assignment will ask you to analyze data reported in Solomon et al (2018). \n",
    "\n",
    "Both studies involve delayed free recall of “unrelated” word lists, but the first study was carried out in healthy young adults, using scalp EEG, and the second study was carried out in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing a neurosurgical evaluation that required implantation of depth electrodes through small openings in the skull. You will not analyze the entire datasets for this assignment; rather, you will analyze a significant subset of subjects. All analyses in this project should include the following data processing steps unless the question explicitly instructs you to do otherwise:\n",
    "1. For scalp EEG data (Part 1), use LCF “cleaned” data.\n",
    "2. After loading the data, apply a Butterworth notch filter around 60 Hz (freqs = [58-62]) to remove line noise.\n",
    "3. Include a 1000 ms buffer around time period of interest when computing power; compute power using raw voltage at the original sampling rate.\n",
    "4. All logarithms referenced in this assignment are base-10 logarithms (e.g., np.log10, not np.log, which is the natural log)."

    "### Question 4\n",
    "In this problem, your goal is to assess the effects of two important processing steps on the analyses in the previous problem. Two common normalization procedures used in the analysis of brain signals are the log-transform, which attenuates extremely large values, and the z-transform, which allows you to normalize power values according to some baseline distribution. Here you will reproduce the analysis of the previous problem in computing between-subject differences of power spectra between recalled and not recalled items with each of these steps separately. The log-transform can be applied at different points in the analysis stream: immediately after computing power values, after averaging power values for each encoding interval, or after computing the z-transform of the power values. Similarly, the z-transformation can be done by normalizing to power (or log-power values) based on many choices of the “distribution” of power (or log-power values). If our goal is to normalize data to the distribution of power values across a given session, how do you define the “distribution” over which to estimate the standard deviation of values? Consider three different choices and assess the effects of these choices on your final analysis:\n",

    "In this part, you will analyze intracranial EEG data. When working with intracranial EEG data you need to bear in mind the standard arrangement that can be used to average across subjects. A key step in the processing of these data involves using CT and MRI scans to localize the electrodes and then matching up these localizations to a standard brain map based on the average of many patients’ brains. Fortunately for you, this step has already been taken care of by the researchers who assembled these data. All you need to know is how to obtain the location tags for each electrode in each patient. For this part, you will analyze data from patients in 'intrac_subs'. Each of these patients was chosen because they have at least three sessions of Fr1/CatFR1 data and their recall performance was at least 30%. For each of these subjects, use the following processing steps:\n",

With intracranial EEG, however, the average reference is not always well defined because each subject will have their own idiosyncratic arrangement of electrodes, with some regions, such as medial temporal lobe and lateral temporal cortex, being systematically selected for the clinical treatment of epilepsy. For this problem:\n",
    " * Create an average reference by first computing an average across electrodes within each lobe of the brain being analyzed, then average the averages across the lobes but only for lobes that have at least 5 electrodes. \n",
    "    * This will ensure that each lobe is equally weighted within the overall average.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Recompute the analysis in the previous problem using this method (again separately at 10 Hz and 147 Hz). \n",
    "2) Compare your results and comment on the strengths and weaknesses of each."
