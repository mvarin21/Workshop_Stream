    "In the following project you will analyze a multi-session free recall experiment to determine the spectral biomarkers of successful memory encoding. To determine differences in brain activity (EEG signals) that predict whether a studied item will be subsequently remembered (recalled) you will compare two classes of events: word encodings that led to later recall and those that did not.  This assignment will ask you to analyze data from the ltpFR2 dataset (Kahana et al., 2018, JEP:LMC).  You will not analyze the entire dataset; rather, you will analyze a significant subset of subjects, specifically those listed as 'scalp_subs' below. \n",

    "All analyses in this project should include the following data processing steps unless the question explicitly instructs you to do otherwise:\n",
    "1. For scalp EEG data, use LCF “cleaned” data.\n",
    "2. After loading the data, apply a Butterworth notch filter around 60 Hz (freqs = [58-62]) to remove line noise.\n",
    "3. Include a 1000 ms buffer around time period of interest when computing power; compute power using raw voltage at the original sampling rate.\n",
    "4. All logarithms referenced in this assignment are base-10 logarithms (e.g., np.log10, not np.log, which is the natural log)."
