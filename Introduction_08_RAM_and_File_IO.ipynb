Pickle is a \"do not share it\" data format, because there are security considerations where loading pickled data can actually execute code in the file.

Pickled data is NOT compatible if, for example, you save data for an object of a class type, and then change the class!  The same type needs to be available when you reload.  This means it will often stop working even on standard types or common library types if you upgrade to a new version of Python or new environment.  Hence, it is a powerful and useful temporary local-use format."
